# NBA Shot Analysis

## Project Overview
This project explores NBA shot logs to uncover patterns in shot accuracy based on distance and defender proximity.

## Key Insights
1. Shot accuracy decreases significantly with distance.
2. Defender proximity has a measurable impact on shot success.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python**: Data processing (`pandas`, `numpy`) and visualizations (`matplotlib`, `seaborn`).
- **GitHub**: Version control and project hosting.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For reproducible analysis.
